Emulators have always fascinated me. It's thanks to them that we're able to play video-games from antique consoles like the NES and Atari on our modern devices. I guess I've always liked dissassembling and reverse-engineering things.

Want to get into the world of emulators? CHIP-8 is most likely your best bet as a starting point. It doesn't have much fancy stuff, its instruction set is relatively small, and it'll show you the ropes of emulating. You could say it's the "Hello world" of emulators.

## OK, but what's CHIP-8?

CHIP-8 is an interpreted programming language developed by Joseph Weisbecker around the mid-1970s. It was initially implemented in the COSMAC VIP and Telmac 1800 microcomputers, its main goal being to make game development easier for these systems. Consequently, it has a handful of videogame-oriented features such as sprites, sound, and a font. [You can read more about CHIP-8 on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8)

Now, as you can see, CHIP-8 isn't a piece of hardware, so it's not something you can emulate _per-se_. Technically speaking, you'll actually be making a CHIP-8 **interpreter**, not an emulator.

## Getting ready

In the following posts, I'll be teaching you how to make a CHIP-8 interpreter from the ground-up, along with all the concepts you need to know before getting started. We'll be taking a look at binary and hexadecimal numbers, bit manipulation techniques, execution timing, CPUs, and more.

This guide will be language-agnostic, meaning you can follow along with any programming language you'd like. I might provide a few small code examples along the day, but I'll try to keep them simple and easy to understand no matter what language you're using. Nevertheless, you should have some degree of programming experience, and be decently comfortable with your language. Otherwise, you'll probably end up lost and confused.

Well, that's all for the intro. See you in the next post!
