Yo! This is just a post to test out my blog, mostly the Markdown rendering part. We got **bold text**, [links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), `code snippets`, and _italics_, it seems.

~~Wait, strike-through doesn't work.~~ Cool, now it does.

```typescript
// This function checks if a given number is even
function isEven(n: number): boolean {
  return n % 2 === 0;
}
```

Code blocks work too. That's important.

We got $\LaTeX$, too:

$$
\frac{d}{dx} \left( \int_a^x f(t) \, dt \right) = f(x).
$$

Tables also seem to work...

| Name | Age | Favorite color |
| :--- | :-: | -------------: |
| John | 32  |          Green |
| Anne | 26  |            Red |
| Bob  | 31  |         Yellow |

Hmmm, and lists?

1. Foo
2. Bar
3. Baz

- Foo
- Bar
- Baz

## This is a h2

### This is a h3

#### This is a h4

##### This is a h5

Yes, it looks like everything's going good.
