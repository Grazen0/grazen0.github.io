So, it looks like December is just around the corner. You know what that means?

Christmas!

And what's a better way to spend your 25 days of Christmas than to solve increasingly difficult programming challenges every single day?

Yes, I know that sounds oddly specific. Let me explain.

## Advent of Code? What's that?

(Glad you asked)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an annual programming event created by Eric Wastl that consists of small coding challenges which you can solve in any language you'd like. The problems deal with a wide range of programming topics, but they can be approached by even the newest of programmers.

Each year's challenges revolve around some sort of "saving christmas"-related storyline, like infiltrating into the Easter Bunny's super-secret lair or trying to find Santa's lost sleigh keys in the depths of the ocean. It's nothing complicated or anything, but I it does add a lot of charm to each challenge!

## How does it work?

Each day of December, a new puzzle is made available. This includes its instructions and a handful of test cases to try out your solution with. More importantly, you'll get your own puzzle input, which you'll have to use to find out the answer accordingly.

Then, it's time to get your hands dirty on some code! There are no rules: you can use literally any language (or platform) you'd like. Run some test cases, debug, and fix. Once you think your solution is ready, use the real input and finally submit your answer. Got the wrong solution? You can always try again.

> Is your PC a 10 year-old cluster of nuts and bolts? Worry not, as every single puzzle's solution is designed to run in 15 seconds at most, even in the most primitive hardware.

## The community

Yes, Advent of Code is great, but its community is equally great too! The [AoC subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) might just be one of my favorite places on the internet to visit during December; it's always fun to see so many enthusiastic people doing whatever crazy ideas they come up with.

Say, check this out: someone managed to do Advent of Code on their original NES!

Not impressive enough? Well, some guy named James Stanley [did Advent of Code on his own custom 16-bit CPU](https://incoherency.co.uk/blog/stories/advent-of-code-on-scamp.html)!

A lot of people also use the subreddit to ask for help or guidance on some puzzles, and it's always nice to see how supportive the community is with them! I truly believe that Advent of Code has built one of the most beginner-friendly programming communities ever, and I love to be a part of it.

## What are you waiting for?

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is a great puzzle event for programmers of all types, and I bet you'll love it, too! It's starting in just a few days, so make sure to be ready for when the time comes.

(Also, you might wanna go check out [Eric Wastl's Twitter](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), the guy's great!)

Well, that's all by me for now. Everyone, go grab your ASCII Christmas hats, and peace out!
