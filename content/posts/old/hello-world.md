Alright, let's see what we got here.

**Bold text**? Check.

> Block quotes? Check

[Links](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ), `code snippets`, _italics_? All check.

~~Hold on, strike-through doesn't work.~~ Cool, now it does.

```typescript
// This function checks if a given number is even
function isEven(num: number): boolean {
  return num % 2 === 0;
}
```

Code blocks work too. That's important.

Oh, hello there! I was just testing out my new blog. Well, it's not actually done at the time I'm writing this. Just gonna use this for testing as soon as I get it working.

Interested? You can go read more [about me](/about), or take a look at the [posts](/posts) I've made. Who knows? Maybe you'll find something new or useful.

Also, why not check out my [main website](https://grazen0.github.io)? (Wink)
